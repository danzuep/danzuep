# About Me
- My wife and I are Kiwis :kiwi_fruit: (i.e. from New Zealand) currently living in Hong Kong.
- At university I studied Electrical and Electronic Engineering with a minor in software and computing, but ended up doing Software Engineering full time including starting my own freelance contracting business.
- I enjoy designing full-stack solutions from scratch, most commonly with SQL or MongoDB, <img src="https://github.com/vscode-icons/vscode-icons/raw/master/icons/file_type_csharp2.svg" width="20" alt="C# .NET">, and WPF/MAUI or Razor/Blazor.
