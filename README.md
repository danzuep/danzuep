# About Me
- My wife and I are from New Zealand which makes me a Kiwi :kiwi_fruit:, but we moved to Hong Kong :hong_kong: in 2022.
- I studied Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Canterbury University with a minor in software and computing :computer: but at some point changed to do Software Engineering full time and started my own contracting business.
- I enjoy designing full-stack solutions from scratch, most commonly with <img src="https://github.com/vscode-icons/vscode-icons/raw/master/icons/file_type_csharp2.svg" width="20" alt="csharp"> and <img src="https://github.com/vscode-icons/vscode-icons/raw/master/icons/file_type_sql.svg" width="20" alt="sql">.
